# Contributing to SWVO
Thank you for your interest in contributing to [SWVO](https://github.com/GFZ/SWVO). This guide explains the development workflow, coding standards, and testing requirements.
## Getting Started
1.  Fork the repository and clone it locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SWVO.git
    cd SWVO
    ```
2.  Create a feature branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature
    ```
## Code Style and Linting
We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting, formatting, and import sorting.
1.  To check your code for issues:
    ```bash
    ruff check .
    ```
2. To automatically apply available fixes:
	```bash
	ruff check . --fix
	```
3. If Ruff cannot auto-fix an issue, fix it manually.
4. [Optional] Ruff is also integrated with `pre-commit`. To enable it:
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```
    This ensures Ruff runs automatically on changed files before each commit.
    
## Running Tests
We use `pytest` for testing.
1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    
2.  Run the test suite locally:
    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/io
    ```
All new code should include tests when applicable.
> [!NOTE]  
> Tests may occasionally fail due to JSON parsing errors or server timeouts. These failures are not critical. Contributors should ensure that the implemented feature functions correctly and does not break any related functionality.
## Pull Requests
1.  Push your branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin my-feature
    ```
    
2.  Open a Pull Request (PR) against `main`.
    
    -   Clearly describe the purpose of the changes.
    -   Reference related issues if applicable.
        
CI will automatically run Ruff and the test suite on your PR.
-   If Ruff fails and cannot auto-fix, you must resolve the issues before merging.
-   If tests fail, update your code or test cases accordingly.
    
## Commit Messages
-   Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
-   Example:
    ```
    Fix handling of missing satellite data in solar wind reader
    ```
## Review Process
-   At least one maintainer must review and approve your PR.
-   Be open to feedback and make the requested changes.
    
## Additional Notes
-   Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
-   Document new functions or modules.
